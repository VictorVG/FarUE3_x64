FarColorer
==========
FarColorer is a syntax highlighting plugin for Far Manager.
[![build](https://github.com/colorer/FarColorer/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/colorer/FarColorer/actions?query=workflow%3A%22build%22)

It only works for (F4)Edit file. (F3)View is not supported, as there is no API.
But you can type in the console `clr:name_of_file`. This launches the built-in viewer colorer.
