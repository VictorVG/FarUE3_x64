1.2. Settings.

Some plugin options are not available in configuration dialog.
They can be configured in file observer.ini which resides in plugin directory.

Also plugin supports user-specific configuration file observer_user.ini.
This file may be useful in cases where editing of main configuration file, which is present
in installation package, is unwanted for some reason.
Structure of the observer_user.ini is the same as for observer.ini. Values from user file
take precedence over main configutration file.

Values from observer_user.ini extend and override values from observer.ini.
Comments are ignored for both files. Commenting value in observer_user.ini will not
remove same value from observer.ini.

Main plugin options are in [General] section.
Settings for each individual module will reside with section with module name.

List of loadable modules is in [Modules] section.
Modules are loaded in order in which they are listed here. For new module to be loaded it must be listed in this section.

To disable particular module in observer_user.ini you need to set "-" (without quotes) instead of module path.

Note: For per-user plugin settings you can manualy create value in registry
branch with plugin settings. It must have same name as in .ini file.
Value in registry have priority over same value in file.
All of this is actual for [General] section only.

Currently you can configure following options:

1.2.1 General settings.

[General] -> PanelHeaderPrefix
Here you can set string that will be shown in file panel header before module name.
Works for all modules simultaneously. Maximum value size in 32 symbols.
Values larger then that will be simply ignored.

[General] -> ExtendedCurDir
This value controls format of current directory value reported back to FAR.
Extended format allows usage of "Folders History" feature to navigate inside containers.
Possible values: 1 (extended mode is on) or 0 (standard format is used).
WARNING:
This feature uses undocumented specifics of curent directory processing by FAR,
so it can have unpredictabe side-effects or stop working at all after next update.

[General] -> VerboseModuleLoad
Turns on/off warning message on plugin start if any if the modules failed to load.
Possible values: 1 (show message) or 0 (don't show).

1.2.2 Filters.

[Filters]
This section sets file extention masks for modules to speed up files processing.
Filters are used when entering file by Enter or PgDn keys.
When plugins menu (F11) or prefix is used filters are ignored.
Values are set in following format: ModuleName=.ext1;.ext2;.ext3
Module names are from [Modules] section and case sensitive. Extentions in list are seprated
by semicolon and have dot in front. They are case-insensitive.
If any module don't have filters set or extentions list is empty, then it is considered
that module accepts all files.

1.2.3 Module-specific configuration.

Values marked with * are default values.

[ISO] -> Charset
[VDISK] -> DefaultCodepage
Default code page for non-Unicode file names.
You can set here specific code page (e.g. 866 or 1251),
or you can set special system code page values:
1 - current OEM code page (default value),
0 - current ANSI code page.

[ISO] -> RockRidge
Enables (1)* / disables (0) support for RockRidge extension.

[PST] -> HideEmptyFolder
Enables (1) / disables (0)* hiding of empty folders.

[WCX] -> WcxLocation
Full path to the location of wcx files. Default value is folder named "wcx" in the same folder as module file.
[WCX] -> RecursiveLoad
Enables (1)* / disables (0) recursive scan when searching for wcx.

1.2.4 Module selection shortcuts.

[Shortcuts]
Here you can set shortcut symbol for module that can be used in module selection menu.
Shortcut can be a number of any alphabetical character ('A' - 'Z'). Character case is irrelevant.

1.3 Plugin configuration dialog.

As opposed to setttings, described in 1.2, which applied only on program start,
some parameters can be changed from configuration dialog (F9 -> Options -> Plugins Configuration).
These values are applied right after dialog is closed (unless you hit 'Cancel' or Esc).
Here you can set the following parameters:

- Enable/disable reaction on Ctrl-PgDn (plugin is always available from F11 menu).
- Configure plugin prefix (default value is 'observe').
- Enable/disable using of extesion filters (see 1.2.2 above).
