Exif.Image.YCbCrPositioning	The position of chrominance components in relation to the luminance component. This field is designated only for JPEG compressed data or uncompressed YCbCr data. The TIFF default is 1 (centered); but when Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:2 it is recommended in this standard that 2 (co-sited) be used to record data, in order to improve the image quality when viewed on TV systems. When this field does not exist, the reader shall assume the TIFF default. In the case of Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:0, the TIFF default (centered) is recommended. If the reader does not have the capability of supporting both kinds of <YCbCrPositioning>, it shall follow the TIFF default regardless of the value in this field. It is preferable that readers be able to support both centered and co-sited positioning.
Exif.Image.ReferenceBlackWhite	The reference black point value and reference white point value. No defaults are given in TIFF, but the values below are given as defaults here.

It is the copyright notice of the person or organization claiming rights to the image. The Interoperability copyright statement including date and rights should be written in this field; e.g., 'Copyright, John Smith, 19xx. All rights reserved.'. In this standard the field records both the photographer and editor copyrights, with each recorded in a separate part of the statement. When there is a clear distinction between the photographer and editor copyrights, these are to be written in the order of photographer followed by editor copyright, separated by NULL (in this case since the statement also ends with a NULL, there are two NULL codes). When only the photographer copyright is given, it is terminated by one NULL code . When only the editor copyright is given, the photographer copyright part consists of one space followed by a terminating NULL code, then the editor copyright is given. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.

Exif.Image.DNGVersion	This tag encodes the DNG four-tier version number. For files compliant with version 1.1.0.0 of the DNG specification, this tag should contain the bytes: 1, 1, 0, 0.
Exif.Image.DNGBackwardVersion	This tag specifies the oldest version of the Digital Negative specification for which a file is compatible. Readers shouldnot attempt to read a file if this tag specifies a version number that is higher than the version number of the specification the reader was based on.  In addition to checking the version tags, readers should, for all tags, check the types, counts, and values, to verify it is able to correctly read the file.
Exif.Image.UniqueCameraModel	Defines a unique, non-localized name for the camera model that created the image in the raw file. This name should include the manufacturer's name to avoid conflicts, and should not be localized, even if the camera name itself is localized for different markets (see LocalizedCameraModel). This string may be used by reader software to index into per-model preferences and replacement profiles.
Exif.Image.LocalizedCameraModel	Similar to the UniqueCameraModel field, except the name can be localized for different markets to match the localization of the camera name.
Exif.Image.CFAPlaneColor	Provides a mapping between the values in the CFAPattern tag and the plane numbers in LinearRaw space. This is a required tag for non-RGB CFA images.
Exif.Image.CFALayout	Describes the spatial layout of the CFA.
Exif.Image.LinearizationTable	Describes a lookup table that maps stored values into linear values. This tag is typically used to increase compression ratios by storing the raw data in a non-linear, more visually uniform space with fewer total encoding levels. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
Exif.Image.BlackLevelRepeatDim	Specifies repeat pattern size for the BlackLevel tag.
Exif.Image.BlackLevel	Specifies the zero light (a.k.a. thermal black or black current) encoding level, as a repeating pattern. The origin of this pattern is the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle. The values are stored in row-column-sample scan order.
Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaH	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image column, BlackLevelDeltaH specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each column and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaV	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image row, this tag specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each row and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
Exif.Image.WhiteLevel	This tag specifies the fully saturated encoding level for the raw sample values. Saturation is caused either by the sensor itself becoming highly non-linear in response, or by the camera's analog to digital converter clipping.
Exif.Image.DefaultScale	DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count. For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.
Exif.Image.DefaultCropOrigin	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.
Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).
Exif.Image.ColorMatrix1	ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order. The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.
Exif.Image.ColorMatrix2	ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.
Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1	CameraClalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1	ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2	ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
Exif.Image.AnalogBalance	Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
Exif.Image.BaselineExposure	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
Exif.Image.BaselineNoise	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
Exif.Image.LensInfo	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
Exif.Image.ShadowScale	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData	Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.
Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety	MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.
Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1	The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag.
Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2	The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown).
Exif.Image.BestQualityScale	For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.
Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID	This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.
Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.
Exif.Image.ActiveArea	This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.
Exif.Image.MaskedAreas	This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile	This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix	This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag.
