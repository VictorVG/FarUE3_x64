$^#NTFS File Information 5.5.2#

This plugin provides various information about files on NTFS file system. Features:

1. Determine file size on disk. Especially useful for compressed and sparse files. Total size is shown for multiple files / directories.

2. List NTFS attributes (file components on NTFS file system). Can be used to get information about:
  - alternate file names (hard links)
  - alternate data streams (named DATA attribute)
  - symbolic link targets
  Prefix: #nfi#

3. Analyze file fragmentation and perform defragmentation.
  Prefix: #defrag#

4. Analyze file contents:
  - estimate if compression of file data is possible (using very FAST LZO algorithm)
  - calculate most useful file hashes: crc32, md5, sha1, sha256, ed2k (eMule variation).
  Prefix: #nfc#

5. Perform fast file search over entire volume using MFT index mode.

6. Manage alternate data streams.

7. Examine file version info.
  Prefix: #nfv#

8. Compress files using NTFS compression.

$^#NTFS File Information 5.5.2#
$ #File information#
    Displays NTFS file attribute (file component) table.

Basic attributes:
    #FILE_NAME# - file name (short, long or hard link).
Full path is shown for every hard link.
    #DATA# - data stream. Name is shown for alternate data streams.
You can use <file name>:<stream name> syntax to access data streams.
    #REPARSE_POINT# - reparse point (directory junction, mount point, symbolic link).
Target path is shown in Name/Data column.

Attribute information:
    #RXCES# - flags. R - resident attribute (this attribute is located entirely inside MFT).
X - attribute uses more than one MFT record.
CES - attribute is compressed / encrypted / sparse.
    #Data Size# - amount of data stored in this attribute. Hard links are counted separately.
    #Disk Size# - amount of disk space consumed by attribute.
    #Fragments# - number of fragments (continuous cluster chains). 1 means no fragmentation.
Total number of excess fragments is shown in the summary (empty value means file is not fragmented).
    #Name/Data# - attribute specific data like file name, symbolic link target, etc.

Summary is shown for directories and multiple files:
    number of files and directories processed, symbolic and hard links (+rp and +hl)
    #Unnamed DATA Total# - files totals.
    #Named DATA Total# - alternate streams totals.
    #Non-Resident Total# - non-resident attributes totals.

@file_panel_mode
$^#NTFS File Information 5.5.2#
$ #File panel mode#
~Customizing file panel view modes~@:PanelViewModes@

Custom columns:
    #DSZ# - file data size i.e. size of DATA attribute(s). For attributes - attribute data size.
    #RSZ# - disk space consumed by file.
    #FRG# - number of excess file fragments.
    #STM# - number of data streams (DATA attributes).
    #LNK# - number of hard links (alternative file names).
    #MFT# - number of MFT records consumed by file.
    #VSZ# - valid size of DATA attribute(s). For attributes - attribute valid size.

    Sorting option #Sort by:# is applyed when 'Unsorted' mode (Ctrl+F7) is selected in FAR.
    #Show streams# - alternate file streams will be shown on file panel.
    #Use highlighting# - enables file highlighting. Disable to speed up processing of large file lists.
    #Backward MFT scan# - MFT scan mode. Select value that provides best performance on your system.
    #Use USN journal# - enables fast panel updates when using MFT Index mode. File list will not be updated
when this option is disabled unless Ctrl+R is pressed. USN journal parameters can be changed using system utility #fsutil#.
    #Use MFT index cache# - when enabled MFT index will be saved into file to speed its load next time.
USN journal must be enabled for cache to work. Note that file defragmentation applications do not write change records
into USN journal thus cache can contain incorrect information after using such utilities (built-in defragmenter will work properly). 
    #Cache directory# - directory to store cache files in. Environment variables are expanded.

    #Flat mode# - enables simultaneous display of all files found in current directory and its subdirectories.
    #MFT index# - enables alternative way of getting file lists. All information is read
from MFT instead of using traditional directory listing methods.

@compress_files
$^#NTFS File Information 5.5.2#
$ #Compress files#

Compress files using NTFS compression. Files are selected using specified criteria:
    #Min. file size# - minimum allowed file size in megabytes.
    #Max. compression ratio# - compressed/uncompressed size ratio should not exceed specified percent value.

Files are defragmented after compression.
