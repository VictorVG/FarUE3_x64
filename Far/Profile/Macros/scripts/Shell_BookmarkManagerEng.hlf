^#Purpose#

   Bookmark manager allows you to assign a bookmark to a folder or file and jump to bookmark or to existing folders from environment variables.
Additionally for element may do two commands from system context menu: open and edit.
Also it is possible to use ~key combinations~@keys@, ~prefixes~@prefix@ and call script from Far plugin or drive menu.
For use from drive menu script hides in bookmarks objects, that do not suit (e.g., folders for right panel only in left panel menu).
Empty bookmarks are grayed and cannot be used for jumping.
On starting script from panel drive menu active is panel, for which drive menu was selected, and passive - other.
Bookmark is a sequence of characters (letters and digits), which mapped one or more folders (files).
This menu lets you to manage bookmarks interactive.
And it may be caused when the typed sequence overlaps with an existing bookmark or environment variable.

@prefix
$^Command line

^#Purpose#

  At the command prompt you can enter commands that begin with one of the prefixes.
  Command format: |use bookmark/environment variable: #prefix#:[#sequence#[#addition beginning from '\'#]];
                  |help call: #prefix#:;
                  |other: #prefix#:[#sequence# [#value#]].

Because the bookmark names are translated into characters typed while holding down the Ctrl,
then, for example, #Фильмы# equivalent to #ABKMVS#.

$^Create/change/copy bookmark interactively

^#Purpose#

  This dialog is designed for bookmark name/value/location changing, bookmark deleting (simply delete bookmark value) or new bookmark creation.
Depend on selected operation in first case bookmark may be copied or changed.

^#Bookmark format#

  Bookmark name may contain following characters: #',-./0123456789;=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]`#.
Illegal symbol, pressed on same key with legal, replaced with this legal or ignored.
For example, typed in Cyrillic layout bookmark #"Хлам"# will be converted to #'[KFV'#.

  Bookmark value may be in old or new format.

  Old bookmark value format: |[<[#Modifier#]>][#Active panel value#][<[#Modifier#]>#Passive panel value#].
#Active panel value# changes active Far panel. #Passive panel value# changes passive Far panel.
  New bookmark value format: |<#Tag#[#Modifier#]>#Value#[<#Tag#[#Modifier#]>#Value#[...]].

  Tag indicates, on which panel folder will be changed. Modifier corrects action for value.
Value can contain full name of existing folder or file, or mask (including local drive name mask).
Also depend on ~configuration~@config@, part of full name, do not corresponding to real element, can be interpreted as mask.
If mask corresponds to several elements, menu is displayed for select a single.
In this case, an action with an element may be selected, similar to the ~bookmark menu~@main@.
If value is folder, it is opened in panel.
If value is file, folder, containing it, is opened in panel, than file becomes a current.
Value can contain environment variables.

  There are four tags:   #A# - |active panel;
                         #P# - |passive panel;
                         #L# - |left panel;
                         #R# - |right panel.

  There are three modifiers: #C# - |when new folders on panels are set, make this panel active.
                             #X# - |do not change panels, open element with OS capabilities.
                             #E# - |do not change panels, edit element with OS capabilities.

  In case, if for one panel some folders indicate or many tags are followed by modifier, last variant acts.

  Full folder format for any bookmark:
    [#Plugin#]||[#File-container#]|[#Path in plugin/file-container#]|[#Parameter#], allowable
    [#Plugin#]||[#Path in plugin#]|[#Parameter#] or
