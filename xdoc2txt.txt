xdoc2txt - extracts text from various binary documents such as PDF, WORD,
EXCEL, and Ichitaro

Overview

  * xdoc2txt is a general-purpose text converter that extracts text
    elements from various binary documents such as PDF, WORD, EXCEL, and
    Ichitaro, and operates on the Windows command line.
  * Since xdoc2txt directly analyzes the structure of various documents,
    it can be converted independently. You do not need to install the
    original application such as WORD or Acrobat.
  * Since it operates at high speed, it is ideal for filters of various
    full-text search engines.
  * The type of word processing document is determined by the extension.

    It supports files with the following extensions.

    .rtf 	Rich text
    .docx 	Microsoft WORD 2007/2010/2013 (OOXML)
    .xlsx 	Microsoft Excel 2007/2010/2013 (OOXML)
    .pptx 	Microsoft PowerPoint 2007/2010/2013 (OOXML)
    .doc 	Microsoft WORD ver5.0/95/97/2000/XP/2003
    .xls 	Microsoft Excel ver5.0/95/97/2000/XP/2003
    .ppt 	Microsoft PowerPoint 97/2000/XP/2003
    .sxw/.sxc/.sxi/.sxd 	OpenOffice.org

    .jaw/jtw 	Ichitaro ver5
    .jbw/juw 	Ichitaro ver6
    .jfw/jvw 	Ichitaro ver7
    .jtd/jtt 	Ichitaro ver8/9/10/11/12

    .pdf 	Adobe PDF
    .mht/mhtml 	Web archive
    .html 	HTML
    .eml 	Outlook Express export format

  * From Ver2.0, iFilter is supported. Even if the extension is not
    natively supported by xdoc2txt, text extraction can be performed
    with the corresponding iFilter. (This is a function of the exe
    version only)
  * There are exe version, Dll version, and COM component version. The
    functions of text extraction are equivalent.

    that there is a space between characters.

How to use

  * The following example writes the text contained in the MS-Word
    document sample.doc to standard output.

  xdoc2txt sample.doc

    You can also save it to a file by redirecting the output as follows:

  xdoc2txt sample.doc >sample.txt

    With the -f option, you can redirect the output to a file. The
    extension will automatically be .txt.

  xdoc2txt -f sample.doc sample.xls

    Since the wild card *? Can be used, multiple files can be converted
    to text at once.

  xdoc2txt -f *.xls

    For Office documents and Ichitaro documents (Ver8 or later), you can
    display the document properties with the -p option. Only the set
    items of the property are displayed.

  xdoc2txt -p Manual.doc

  Execution result:

   <Title>KWIC Finder Manual</Title>

    application may differ.
